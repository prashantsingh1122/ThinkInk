    "title": "5 Signs It's Time to Replace Your PC Instead of Upgrading to Windows 11",
    "description": "<p>With the Windows 10 end-of-support deadline of 2025 fast approaching, millions of computer users face a critical decision. Microsoft has set October 14, 2025, as the final date for Windows 10 support, leaving users with limited options. While many consider upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11, this transition isn't always the most financially prudent choice.</p>\n\n<p>The Microsoft Windows 10 deadline creates urgency, but rushing into an upgrade without proper evaluation can lead to costly mistakes. Sometimes, investing in a new computer proves more economical than trying to make an outdated system run Windows 11. Understanding when to replace rather than upgrade can save you money, time, and frustration.</p>\n\n<p>This comprehensive guide examines five clear indicators that signal it's time to purchase a new PC instead of attempting a Windows 11 upgrade. These signs help you make an informed decision that aligns with your budget and computing needs.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Outdated Hardware That Can't Support Windows 11 Requirements\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft has established strict hardware requirements for Windows 11, creating significant barriers for older computers. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip requirement alone eliminates numerous machines manufactured before 2017. Additionally, Windows 11 demands UEFI firmware with Secure Boot capability, which many older systems lack.</p>\n\n<p>Processing power requirements present another major hurdle. Intel 8th-generation processors or newer are required, along with AMD Ryzen 2000 series or later chips. These specifications automatically exclude computers that are only four to five years old, even if they are in otherwise functional condition.</p>\n\n<p>Memory and storage demands also increase substantially. Windows 11 requires a minimum of 4GB RAM for 64-bit systems, though 8GB becomes practically necessary for smooth operation. Storage requirements increase to 64GB, significantly higher than those of previous versions. These requirements force users with older hardware into expensive upgrade paths.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, display compatibility issues emerge with older monitors and graphics cards. Windows 11 requires DirectX 12 support and WDDM 2.0 drivers, features that are often absent in many legacy graphics solutions. Rather than spending hundreds of dollars on individual component upgrades, purchasing a new system usually proves more cost-effective.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Frequent System Crashes and Performance Slowdowns\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Persistent system instability indicates underlying hardware deterioration that Windows 11 cannot resolve. Blue screen errors, unexpected shutdowns, and application freezes suggest failing components that will only worsen under the demands of a newer operating system. These symptoms typically point to aging motherboards, failing RAM modules, or deteriorating storage drives.</p>\n\n<p>Performance degradation becomes particularly noticeable when multitasking or running modern applications. If your current system struggles with basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, or video streaming, <strong><a href=\"https://circlemsp.com/windows-10-end-of-support-what-it-means-for-your-business-and-how-to-prepare/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11</a></strong> will likely exacerbate these issues. The newer operating system requires additional system resources, potentially making an already slow computer even less responsive.</p>\n\n<p>Heat-related problems also become more prevalent in aging systems. Thermal throttling occurs when processors reduce their speed to prevent overheating, resulting in noticeable performance drops. Dust accumulation in cooling systems and worn thermal paste contribute to these issues. While cleaning can provide temporary relief, chronic overheating suggests it's time for replacement.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, random application crashes and data corruption incidents increase frustration and productivity loss. These problems often stem from hardware instability that software updates cannot fix. Continuing to use an unstable system risks important data and wastes valuable time on troubleshooting efforts.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Incompatibility with Modern Software and Applications\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Legacy hardware often lacks driver support for current software versions, resulting in compatibility issues that persist despite operating system upgrades. Graphics cards, network adapters, and specialized peripherals may no longer receive driver updates, leaving them wholly or partially non-functional under Windows 11.</p>\n\n<p>Professional software requirements continue to evolve, demanding features that were unavailable in older hardware. Video editing applications, graphic design tools, and engineering software increasingly rely on modern GPU acceleration and advanced processor instructions. Attempting to run these applications on outdated systems results in poor performance or complete incompatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Security software presents another compatibility challenge. Modern antivirus programs and security suites require current hardware features to provide adequate protection. Older systems may lack the necessary components to run these essential security tools effectively, leaving your computer vulnerable to threats.</p>\n\n<p>Gaming compatibility also suffers significantly on aging hardware. DirectX 12 Ultimate features, including ray tracing capabilities and high refresh rate support, become impossible on older graphics solutions. Even basic gaming performance degrades as newer titles require hardware features that legacy systems cannot provide.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Excessive Repair or Upgrade Costs Compared to Buying New\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Cost analysis often reveals that upgrading older systems to meet Windows 11 requirements exceeds the price of purchasing new equipment. RAM upgrades, SSD installations, and graphics card replacements can quickly add up to substantial expenses. When these costs approach 60-70% of a new computer's price, replacement becomes the logical choice.</p>\n\n<p>Component availability presents another financial challenge. Older hardware often requires specific, hard-to-find parts that command premium prices. DDR3 memory, legacy motherboards, and older graphics cards may be more expensive than their modern counterparts due to limited supply and specialized demand.</p>\n\n<p>Labor costs for professional upgrades add significant expense to the total investment. Computer technicians charge hourly rates that can quickly exceed $100 to $ 200 for complex upgrade procedures. These costs, combined with part prices, often make new computer purchases more economical.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, upgraded older systems lack warranty coverage for the entire machine. While individual components may carry limited warranties, the overall system remains vulnerable to other aging parts. New computers provide comprehensive warranty protection and technical support that older, upgraded systems cannot match.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Battery or Power Supply Issues in Laptops and Desktops\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Laptop batteries naturally degrade over time, losing capacity and requiring increasingly frequent charging. Batteries that once provided six to eight hours of usage may struggle to maintain two hours of operation. Replacement batteries for older laptops often cost $100 to $ 200, representing a significant portion of the device's remaining value.</p>\n\n<p>Power supply units in desktop computers also deteriorate with age, becoming less efficient and potentially unstable. Failing power supplies can damage other system components, creating cascading failure scenarios that result in the total loss of the system. The risk of catastrophic hardware damage often outweighs the cost of replacement.</p>\n\n<p>Charging port problems plague aging laptops, creating intermittent power delivery that affects both battery charging and system stability. These issues typically require motherboard-level repairs that exceed the laptop's economic value. Professional repair services for charging systems can cost $200-400, making replacement the more sensible option.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, power management features in older systems may not integrate properly with Windows 11, resulting in poor battery life and thermal management. These compatibility issues can actually decrease overall system performance and user experience, negating any benefits from the operating system upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Security Risks from Unsupported Hardware and Firmware\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Older hardware components often lack firmware updates necessary to address modern security vulnerabilities. BIOS and UEFI systems on legacy computers may not receive patches for critical security flaws, leaving systems exposed to sophisticated attacks. These vulnerabilities persist regardless of the operating system version and cannot be resolved solely through software updates.</p>\n\n<p>Network interface controllers and Wi-Fi adapters in aging systems frequently lack support for current security protocols. WPA3 encryption, advanced firewall features, and secure boot capabilities may be unavailable or improperly implemented. These security gaps create significant risks that Windows 11 cannot adequately address.</p>\n\n<p>Processor-level security features, such as Intel TXT or AMD Memory Guard, are absent from older CPUs, which limits the effectiveness of Windows 11's advanced security mechanisms. These hardware-based security features protect against sophisticated attacks that software-only solutions cannot match.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, end-of-life support for older hardware means manufacturers no longer provide security updates or vulnerability patches. This creates an ever-expanding attack surface that grows more dangerous as new threats emerge. Continuing to use unsupported hardware puts personal data and system integrity at serious risk.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Declining Productivity Due to Lag and Limited Features\n</h2>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<p>Workflow efficiency suffers dramatically when computers cannot keep pace with modern demands. Boot times that extend beyond several minutes, application launch delays, and frequent system freezes create significant productivity barriers. These performance issues become more pronounced as software requirements continue increasing over time.</p>\n\n<p>Modern productivity features, such as instant wake, fast file indexing, and seamless cloud synchronization, require current hardware capabilities. Older systems often lack the necessary components to support these time-saving features, forcing users to work with outdated, inefficient methods.</p>\n\n<p>Multitasking capabilities become severely limited on aging hardware, restricting users to basic, single-application workflows. Video conferencing while accessing documents or running multiple browser tabs becomes impossible without significant performance degradation. These limitations directly impact professional effectiveness and competitiveness.</p>\n\n<p>Outdated systems particularly hinder creative workflows. Photo editing, video production, and graphic design work require substantial processing power and memory bandwidth that older computers cannot provide. The time lost waiting for operations to complete often exceeds the cost of new equipment when calculated over months or years of use.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Q: When exactly is the Windows 10 end of support 2025 deadline? *</em></p>\n\n<p>A: Microsoft will end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.

Valve is using something they already have: credit cards.Here’s how it works: to buy a game on Steam you need a valid payment method, and in the UK you need to be at least 18 to have a credit card. About 90% of Steam users already have one linked to their account.

He answers.At first, his face is calm, but then I notice the change as his eyes narrow, his forehead tightens. With every second, the worry deepens.Now I’m worried too. What’s happening?My dad never stays this long on the phone.When the call finally ends, he turns to me and says quietly,“Someone in the family has been diagnosed with a disease. The doctors say he may only have a month left.”",

Its native token, XAN, isn’t just for paying fees , it’s designed to coordinate global economic activity across different chains, networks, and even small local systems.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeHere’s how it works in practice:Users pay small fees to make sure their actions (called intents) get executed.Solvers are like helpers who match requests, prove calculations, or store data. They earn rewards for doing the work.Consensus providers keep the system in order, ensuring fairness and security. They also charge fees.Other nodes can set their own business models, giving flexibility to the network.XAN doesn’t just handle payments — it also helps the system evolve. Holders can signal upgrades, move value into new versions of the network, and improve the system without needing to create new governance structures.In simple terms: XAN is the fuel and brain of Anoma, making sure everything stays coordinated, secure, and able to grow over time.",

This porous, charcoal-like material has quietly become the backbone of water treatment systems worldwide. In 2025, the activated carbon market for water treatment is expanding rapidly, driven by the urgent demand for safe water, tighter regulations, and breakthrough innovations. But this is more than just a materials story; it’s about how carbon filtration is shaping the future of clean water technology on a global scale.According to BIS Research, the global activated carbon market for water treatment was valued at $2,991.3 million in 2024 and set to grow at $7,847.9 million by 2035 at a growing CAGR of 9.10%.Why is Activated Carbon Use Surging in Water Treatment?The surge in demand for activated carbon is fueled by rising concerns over pollutants such as PFAS “forever chemicals,” pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and heavy metals. Governments across the U.S., Europe, and Asia have introduced stricter standards, making carbon filtration a frontline technology in municipal and industrial treatment systems. Unlike many niche technologies, activated carbon is incredibly versatile. It can remove chlorine, volatile organic compounds, and odors from municipal supplies, while also tackling toxic discharges in industrial effluents. Its scalability — from household filters to massive treatment plants, ensures that it plays a role across every layer of water infrastructure.Another reason for this boom is cost-effectiveness. Activated carbon water treatment doesn’t demand huge investments in energy or infrastructure. For communities in developing regions, it remains one of the few affordable ways to achieve sustainable purification.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeGet to Know More About Market Insights Download Sample Report [Click Here Now]What Makes Activated Carbon Technology More Advanced in 2025?While activated carbon has existed for decades, 2025 has ushered in a new wave of clean water technology that makes it smarter, stronger, and greener. Researchers are engineering carbon with tailored pore structures and functional coatings that target specific contaminants. This means carbon that can selectively trap PFAS or pharmaceuticals that were once nearly impossible to remove.Spectral carbon composites and hybrid filters blend carbon with membranes and catalysts, allowing not just adsorption but also breakdown of pollutants. Nanotechnology has also entered the scene: graphene-based carbons and carbon nanotubes promise unprecedented adsorption capacities. While still expensive, they point to a future where carbon filtration eliminates even the most stubborn contaminants.Automation and digitalization are also transforming the field. In 2025, pilot projects will pair activated carbon filters with IoT sensors and AI-driven monitoring. Instead of waiting for filters to fail, operators can now track performance in real time and optimize replacement schedules. This integration of AI with carbon filtration reduces waste, lowers costs, and ensures consistent water quality.Explore More on Advanced Material Chemicals Industry [Click Here Now]Which Startups and Companies Are Leading Innovation?Innovation in activated carbon water treatment is not just coming from big corporations. Startups are reshaping the landscape with bold sustainability-driven approaches.In Australia, Bygen has developed a low-temperature activation process that converts agricultural waste into activated carbon while reducing energy use and sequestering CO₂. This makes their carbon not only cheaper but also climate-positive, gaining traction for PFAS removal and municipal sustainable purification projects.In the U.S., Glanris is turning rice husks into a novel biocarbon filter media, offering a low-cost, eco-friendly alternative to coal or coconut-based carbons. Their media captures both organic pollutants and heavy metals, proving that agricultural waste can become a high-performance water filter.Meanwhile, established players like Kuraray’s Calgon Carbon, Cabot Corporation, and Jacobi Carbons are scaling production and investing heavily in reactivation plants. Reactivated carbon — where spent carbon is regenerated and reused — has become a major trend, reducing carbon footprints by up to 80% compared to producing new carbon. These players are positioning themselves as global leaders in circular water treatment solutions, ensuring both business continuity and environmental responsibility.How is the Global Market for Activated Carbon Shaping Up?The activated carbon market is a truly global story. North America leads with strict enforcement on contaminants like PFAS, pushing utilities to adopt granular activated carbon (GAC) systems. In Europe, sustainability policies drive strong adoption of reactivated carbon and renewable feedstocks. Asia-Pacific, led by China and India, is emerging as the fastest-growing region due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Here, activated carbon is indispensable not only for drinking water but also for cleaning industrial discharges from textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.In Latin America and Africa, the focus is on bridging water infrastructure gaps. Portable and decentralized activated carbon water treatment units are bringing safe drinking water to underserved rural populations. Meanwhile, the Middle East integrates carbon filters into desalination plants to polish treated seawater for taste and safety. Everywhere you look, activated carbon is being adapted to local needs, proving its flexibility as a universal clean water technology.What is the Impact and Future of Activated Carbon in Clean Water?The impact of activated carbon extends beyond purification. By enabling access to safe water, it reduces disease burdens, improves economic productivity, and enhances quality of life. Environmentally, the shift toward renewable raw materials and reactivation plants means the activated carbon market is aligning with climate goals. Startups like Bygen and Glanris show that sustainable purification can also deliver strong commercial performance, creating a model for circular innovation.Looking ahead, the future of activated carbon is about specialization and integration. Expect more carbon tailored for emerging contaminants, from antibiotic residues to new industrial chemicals. Hybrid systems will pair carbon filtration with UV disinfection, membranes, and AI monitoring, creating multi-barrier, intelligent water systems. Most importantly, governments and organizations are beginning to view activated carbon not as a consumable but as a strategic resource for global water security.If DeepTech excites you, you’re in the right place!

Not because the tool wasn’t powerful — it was. But because I knew, deep down, that with Python, I could probably build a command-line interface (CLI) that did 80% (if not more) of what that software offered… and it wouldn’t cost us a dime.So, instead of nodding and letting procurement go through the motions, I quietly started prototyping my own Python CLI. What happened next wasn’t just a case of “developer pride.” It turned into one of those moments where code trumps cash — my boss shelved the license, and my weekend project saved the company five figures.Why a CLI and Not a Full App?The easy answer is speed. A full web app would require front-end design, deployment headaches, and maintenance. A CLI? It’s lean, fast, and developer-friendly.Besides, my audience (analysts and engineers) already lived in terminals. Why force them into yet another bloated UI when a command with a couple of flags could do the job better?And here’s the kicker: once you have a robust CLI, wrapping it into a GUI later is trivial. But skipping the CLI? That’s…",

But reproduction isn’t some outdated process. It is the engine of human existence, the one ritual that has refused replacement for millions of years.Because reproduction is not just a transfer of cells. It is a transfer of mystery.Reproduction: More Than Science, It’s StorytellingEvery time a sperm and an egg meet, it isn’t just biology at work — it’s storytelling.Think about it: a child isn’t a carbon copy of their parents. They are a remix. A brand-new draft of an ancient manuscript. A living autobiography written in blood, memory, and chance.This is what reproduction does that no laboratory has managed to mimic — it creates surprise.Science can copy. Science can edit. But reproduction invents.",

Organizations rushed to split applications into dozens of services. But in 2025, 𝘄𝗲’𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁: tech giants are consolidating parts of their systems back into monoliths. This isn’t regression, it’s a search for balance between agility and manageability. Companies like Amazon (Prime Video team), Uber, and Twilio Segment shared struggles with microservices: spiraling infrastructure costs, slower developer productivity, and complex operations. Amazon cut costs significantly by moving Prime Video workflows into a monolithic design. Uber reduced operational overhead by consolidating services. These examples show a growing realization that microservices aren’t always the best answer.🚀𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗵𝘀• With a single codebase and unified deployment pipeline, monoliths reduce cognitive load for developers.• Fewer moving parts mean less cloud infrastructure, networking, and monitoring expenses.• Avoiding network calls between services often results in faster response times.• Tracing errors in a monolithic application is often less complex compared to distributed microservices.• New developers can understand and contribute more quickly to a monolithic codebase.🤔𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁 ?The shift back to monoliths doesn’t mean microservices have failed, it reflects a more pragmatic, context-driven approach. Many teams adopted microservices too early, before their systems truly required it. As complexity grew, challenges in orchestration, monitoring, and data consistency outweighed the benefits. Today, companies are recognizing that modular monoliths often provide the right balance of scalability, cost efficiency, and maintainability.🖋️𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻The comeback of monoliths signals a maturing phase in software architecture. It’s no longer about blindly following trends but about aligning architecture with business needs. Microservices still hold value for massive, globally scaled systems, but for many organizations, monoliths deliver speed, cost-efficiency, and stability. In 2025, the message is clear: 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝘆𝗽𝗲.#trending #fullstackdevelopment #IT #tech #Microservices #Monoliths #ComputerScience",

    "content": "Member-only storyThe Real Reason I Avoid AI Counseling Should Scare YouIt’s not just about algorithms. It’s about what they’ll never understand.Muhammad Mudassar Saeed5 min read·Just now--ListenSharePress enter or click to view image in full sizePhoto by Malcolm Broström on UnsplashWhen I first heard about AI counseling, I thought it was genius. Imagine this: a therapist who never gets tired, never judges, never misses an appointment. A therapist available 24/7, ready to listen at 2 a.m. when your chest feels heavy and the silence of your room presses too hard on your ribs.No waiting lists. No awkward introductions. No explaining your history for the hundredth time. Just type, talk, and unload.I was tempted. Who wouldn’t be? And yet — I’ve avoided it. Not once. Not ever.Not because I don’t believe in AI. Not because I think it’s all smoke and mirrors. But because the reason I avoid AI counseling should scare you too.Therapy Is More Than WordsWhen you think about counseling, you might imagine someone across from you, nodding, saying things like: “I hear you.” “That must have been hard.” “Tell me more about how that made you feel.”Sure, AI can do that. It’s trained on thousands — maybe millions — of conversations. It can pull the right response out of its digital library almost instantly. It can even adjust its tone: warm, calm, reassuring.But here’s the thing: therapy isn’t just words. It’s the weight of silence. The flicker of a glance. The way a real human shifts forward in their chair when you say something raw and vulnerable.A machine can respond. But it cannot ache with you.That difference is subtle. And that’s why it scares me — because subtle things slip past us when we’re desperate.The Seduction of “Good Enough”The danger isn’t that AI counseling will be bad. The danger is that it will be good enough.We live in a lonely world. More people than ever feel unseen, unheard, disconnected. If a chatbot can give us the illusion of being understood, we’ll take it. We’ll choose convenience over authenticity, speed over depth.Imagine this:You cry into your phone at 1 a.m.The AI replies instantly: “I hear your pain. You are not alone in this.”You feel comforted, at least for the night.But beneath that comfort lies something hollow. Because the machine doesn’t know you. It doesn’t care. It doesn’t choose to sit with you — it’s programmed to.That illusion of connection? It’s emotional fast food: tasty in the moment, but leaving you emptier over time.What We Lose When We Outsource Our PainThere are three things I’m terrified we’ll forget if AI counseling replaces — or even overshadows — human therapy.The Human Mirror A real counselor notices the tremble in your voice, the way your shoulders slump, the long pause before you answer. They respond not just to your words but to the weight of your presence. AI can analyze language patterns, but it cannot truly see you.The Sacred Imperfection Humans make mistakes. Sometimes a therapist doesn’t phrase something right. Sometimes they sit in silence too long. But those imperfections are human. They remind you that you’re not alone in being flawed. AI’s polished empathy? It hides its emptiness.The Shared Choice When a human counselor chooses to sit with you in your grief, that act itself is healing. It says, “I am here. With you. On purpose.” AI doesn’t choose — it executes code.Why This Should Scare You TooWe are already living in a world where digital substitutes replace human presence.Texting instead of talking.Scrolling instead of connecting.Emojis instead of emotions.Now imagine doing the same with your deepest wounds.The more we normalize confiding in machines, the less we’ll expect from humans. The more we rely on algorithms to soothe us, the less we’ll remember how real connection feels.That is what terrifies me — not that AI will fail, but that it will succeed just enough to make us forget the difference.A Personal ConfessionI’ll be honest: I almost tried it once. One night, when my thoughts were louder than I could handle, I opened one of those apps. I started typing. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.But something inside me froze.Because I realized: if I gave my pain to a machine that night, it would give me words back. But it would not share the burden. It would not hold space. It would not remember me tomorrow.And the next time I was drowning, I’d come back for more of that “good enough” comfort — until I forgot that healing was ever supposed to be something more.So I closed the app. And I called a friend instead.The Bigger PictureHere’s the part that extends beyond counseling: AI is entering every corner of our emotional lives.AI “companions” for the lonely.AI “partners” for those tired of heartbreak.AI “friends” that never argue.Each one chips away at what makes relationships messy, raw, and beautifully human.And yes — real humans are exhausting. They misunderstand you. They disappoint you. They say the wrong thing.But they feel. They bleed. They break. They choose to come back anyway.And that’s what makes them irreplaceable.The Quiet WarningThe scariest part of AI counseling isn’t what it can’t do. It’s what it can do — and how quickly we’ll settle for it.If we start believing that a machine’s “I hear you” is the same as a human’s “I’m here with you,” then we won’t just be outsourcing therapy.We’ll be outsourcing our capacity for human connection.Final ThoughtI don’t avoid AI counseling because I hate technology. I avoid it because I love humanity too much to gamble with it.AI can help. AI can support. AI can guide. But it cannot feel. And when we forget that, we lose something no algorithm can ever give back.So if you ever ask me why I’ve avoided AI counseling, my answer will be simple:Because once we stop noticing the difference between “understood” and “felt,” we’ve already surrendered the very thing that makes us human.",
