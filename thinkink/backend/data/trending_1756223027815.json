This phantom website, you believe, is the magical gateway to a flood of high-paying clients who will stumble upon your digital doorstep, wallets open, begging to work with you.So you spend weeks, maybe even months, wrestling with it.

    "content": "YouTube’s “Hype” feature, which allows fans to help their favorite creators get discovered, is rolling out globally, the company announced Tuesday. First introduced at Google’s Made on YouTube event in 2024, the feature — a dedicated button that appears below the existing “like” button — will become available on videos from creators with fewer than 500,000 subscribers.\n\nThe feature is now available across 39 countries, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, Korea, Indonesia, and India.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nViewers have the opportunity to hype up to three videos per week for a favorite creator. This gives the video points, which helps it gain traction on a new, ranked leaderboard that YouTube users can find in the Explore menu. To make hyping fair, YouTube says it will give smaller creators a bigger boost. That means if a creator has fewer subscribers, they’ll get a bigger bonus when fans hype their video. \n\nImage Credits:YouTube\n\nVideos that have received this fan boost will display a “hyped” badge, and users can also filter their Home feed on YouTube to see only videos with the new “hyped” category. When a video they’ve hyped is getting close to the leaderboard, YouTube will notify the users who helped hype it. Dedicated fans can show their support by earning a new “hype star” badge every month, as well.\n\nYouTube said it introduced Hype because it saw that passionate fans wanted to be a part of a creator’s success story. However, the addition will also offer YouTube a new revenue stream as the company said it plans to let fans purchase more “hypes” to help boost their favorite videos in the future.\n\n\n\nIn the near term, YouTube is also developing hype leaderboards for specific interests, like gaming and style, and a way for fans to share that they’ve just hyped a video. \n\nCreators can track their hypes and hype points in the YouTube Studio mobile app, and they can check their video analytics for a new Hype card and recap in their weekly data stories.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

A SaaS company, let’s call them “DevFlow,” sold a popular CI/CD tool. During testing, I found a simple IDOR on their customer portal that let me view another user’s billing history. It seemed minor — a $500 bug at best. But I followed the thread. That small tear in the fabric of their access control unraveled a chain of failures that ended with me able to poison the software builds of every one of their customers. The final bounty was $7500.

    "content": "5 نصائح لاختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب المناسب لعملكNadawaled7 min read·Just now--Shareاستضافة مواقع الويبhttps://servers.com.sa/ar/blog/الاستضافة_السحابيةعندما يتعلق الأمر بإدارة نشاط تجاري ناجح عبر الإنترنت، فإن اختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب المناسب أمر بالغ الأهمية. يمكن أن يعني شركة استضافة مواقع الويب الجيد الفرق بين موقع ويب سريع وموثوق وآخر معطل باستمرار وغير مستجيب.في هذه المقالة، سنشارك 5 نصائح لاختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب المناسب لعملك. سنغطي أهمية الجهوزية والموثوقية، والاختلافات بين خيارات الاستضافة المشتركة و VPS والمخصصة، وأهمية دعم العملاء والموارد، وكيفية تقييم خيارات قابلية التوسع التي يقدمها مزود الاستضافة، واعتبارات الأمان والنسخ الاحتياطي للبيانات. باتباع هذه النصائح، ستتمكن من اختيار مزود استضافة الويب الذي سيساعد عملك على الازدهار عبر الإنترنت.أهمية الجهوزية والموثوقية لمقدم الاستضافةيشير الجهوزية إلى مقدار الوقت الذي يكون فيه موقع الويب متاحاً ويمكن للمستخدمين الوصول إليه. يعني شركة استضافة مواقع الويب بنسبة وقت تشغيل عالية أن موقع الويب الخاص بك سيكون جاهزاً للعمل في معظم الأوقات، مما يسمح لعملائك بالوصول إليه متى احتاجوا إلى ذلك. من ناحية أخرى، تعني النسبة المئوية المنخفضة لوقت التشغيل أن موقع الويب الخاص بك سيتعطل كثيراً، مما يؤدي إلى فقدان العملاء وإيرادات محتملة.الموثوقية هي أيضاً عامل مهم عند اختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب. سيضمن شركة استضافة مواقع الويب الموثوق به أن موقع الويب الخاص بك يعمل دائماً، حتى أثناء حركة المرور الكثيفة أو الأحداث غير المتوقعة. سيكون لديهم أيضاً بنية تحتية قوية للتعامل مع أي مشكلات قد تنشأ، وفريق من الخبراء في متناول اليد لحل أي مشاكل بسرعة.من المهم البحث ومقارنة وقت التشغيل وموثوقية شركة استضافة مواقع الويب المختلفين قبل اتخاذ القرار. ابحث عن مقدمي الخدمة الذين يقدمون ما لا يقل عن 99.9٪ من وقت التشغيل ولديهم سجل حافل بالحفاظ على نسب عالية من وقت التشغيل. يمكنك أيضاً التحقق من تقييمات العملاء وتقييماتهم للتعرف على مدى موثوقية مقدم الخدمة.باختصار، يعد الجهوزية والموثوقية من الجوانب الرئيسية التي تحدد نجاح الأعمال التجارية عبر الإنترنت، واختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب يتمتع بسجل جيد للجهوزية والموثوقية سيضمن أن يكون موقع الويب الخاص بك متاحاً دائماً لعملائك، ومن المهم البحث عن هذه العوامل ومقارنتها قبل اتخاذ القرار.الاختلافات بين خيارات الاستضافة المشتركة و VPS والمخصصةعند اختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب، فإن أحد القرارات الرئيسية التي ستحتاج إلى اتخاذها هو نوع خطة الاستضافة التي تختارها. الأنواع الثلاثة الأكثر شيوعاً لخطط الاستضافة هي المشاركة، VPS، والاستضافة المخصصة.الاستضافة المشتركة هي الخيار الأساسي والأقل تكلفة. كما يوحي الاسم، ستشارك موارد الخادم مع مواقع الويب الأخرى. هذا يعني أنه سيكون لديك سيطرة أقل على بيئة الخادم، ولكن هذا يعني أيضاً أن التكلفة أقل. تعد الاستضافة المشتركة خياراً جيداً للمواقع الشخصية الصغيرة أو الشركات الصغيرة التي لا تتوقع الكثير من الزيارات.تعد استضافة VPS (الخادم الخاص الافتراضي) خطوة للأمام من الاستضافة المشتركة. باستخدام استضافة VPS، ستظل تشارك موارد الخادم، ولكن سيكون لديك بيئة افتراضية خاصة بك معزولة عن المستخدمين الآخرين. هذا يعني أنك ستتمتع بقدر أكبر من التحكم في بيئة الخادم وستكون قادراً على تثبيت برامج وتكوينات مخصصة. تعد استضافة VPS خياراً جيداً للشركات الصغيرة والمتوسطة الحجم التي تتوقع المزيد من حركة المرور وتحتاج إلى مزيد من التحكم في بيئة الخادم الخاصة بهم.الاستضافة المخصصة هي الخيار الأغلى والأقوى. من خلال الاستضافة المخصصة، سيكون لديك خادم فعلي خاص بك مخصص فقط لموقع الويب الخاص بك. هذا يعني أنه سيكون لديك سيطرة كاملة على بيئة الخادم ويمكنك تخصيصها وفقاً لاحتياجاتك الدقيقة. تعد الاستضافة المخصصة خياراً جيداً للشركات الكبيرة أو مواقع الويب التي تتوقع عدداً كبيراً من الزيارات.باختصار، عند اختيار خطة الاستضافة، من المهم مراعاة حجم وحركة مرور موقع الويب الخاص بك، بالإضافة إلى ميزانيتك ومستوى التحكم الذي تحتاجه في بيئة الخادم. الاستضافة المشتركة هي الخيار الأكثر تكلفة، ولكنها توفر تحكماً أقل.توفر استضافة VPS مزيداً من التحكم وهي أكثر ملاءمة للشركات والمواقع الصغيرة والمتوسطة الحجم. الاستضافة المخصصة هي الخيار الأقوى والأكثر تكلفة، وهي مناسبة للشركات الكبيرة أو مواقع الويب التي تتوقع الكثير من الزيارات.أهمية دعم العملاء والموارد في شركة استضافة مواقع الويبعند اختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب، يجب أيضاً مراعاة دعم العملاء والموارد. يجب أن يقدم شركة استضافة مواقع الويب الجيد دعماً شاملاً للعملاء متاحاً على مدار الساعة طوال أيام الأسبوع لمساعدتك في أي مشاكل قد تواجهها.يجب أن يكون لديهم أيضاً مجموعة متنوعة من الموارد المتاحة مثل الأسئلة الشائعة والبرامج التعليمية والأدلة لمساعدتك في استكشاف المشكلات وإصلاحها وإعداد موقع الويب الخاص بك.عندما تكون بصدد إعداد موقع الويب الخاص بك، فمن المحتمل أن يكون لديك العديد من الأسئلة، ويمكن لفريق دعم العملاء سريع الاستجابة مساعدتك في الحصول على إجابات بسرعة، حتى تتمكن من التركيز على جوانب أخرى من عملك.يمكن أن يكون الوصول إلى قاعدة معرفية واسعة أو برامج تعليمية مفيداً جداً أيضاً، خاصة إذا لم تكن على دراية باستضافة الويب وإدارة الخادم.بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يمكن أن يساعدك وجود فريق دعم عملاء على دراية بالمنصات والتقنيات المختلفة في اختيار خطة الاستضافة المناسبة وتحقيق أقصى استفادة منها. يمكنهم أيضاً مساعدتك في أي مشاكل فنية قد تواجهها، مثل إعداد الخادم وتكوينه، واستكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها، ومشكلات الأمان.باختصار، يعد دعم العملاء والموارد من العوامل الحاسمة التي يجب مراعاتها عند اختيار شركة استضافة مواقع الويب. من المهم اختيار موفر يقدم دعماً شاملاً للعملاء ومجموعة متنوعة من الموارد لمساعدتك في استكشاف المشاكل وإصلاحها وإعداد موقع الويب الخاص بك. يمكن لفريق دعم العملاء سريع الاستجابة والمعرفة مساعدتك في اختيار خطة الاستضافة المناسبة وتحقيق أقصى استفادة منها، بالإضافة إلى مساعدتك في أي مشكلات

And I know you don’t want to go to work because everyone else is on vacation and you are working your ass off, and you keep on procrastinating like you forgot your ADHD meds. So, I thought it would be a good and friendly gesture to give y’all a good excuse for not answering all your emails for 15 minutes (plus 15 more for you to process it all). And after reading this, you will have something to talk about during your lunch, from 11–14 — like the French do*, so double bonus — from me to you!Let me tell you about something that happened a few months ago.A while back, the International Criminal Court in the Hague (in my country), or the ICC for short, got a wild hair up its ass and they — in all their ‘wisdom’ — decided to declare Netanyahu a war criminal.Now, you would think that’s a big deal.A court doing court things ‘n all. In ‘no’ way it was politically motivated.Uh-huh. Sure. Keep on dreaming Aurora**But then, a certain tangerine-tinted president from across the pond, a man who probably thinks “geopolitics” is a fancy map, decided that he didn’t like that one bit.And what did he do?He told Microsoft to pull the plug. Cut off the ICC’s access to Microsoft Office and their email. Just like that. The prosecutors and judges, who were probably in the middle of typing up some very important legal documents, suddenly found their most basic tools gone.Poof.Vanished.* Bonjour Benjamin LEVY, Julien Cafiero, Romain Schwebel, prêt pour le déjeuner ;) J’espère que tu n’as pas déjà mangé… sinon je vais devoir partager mon petit-déjeuner avec toi !** Aurora = Sleeping Beauty in the Disney PR sugar coated version of Briar Rose in the original Grimm version.More rants after the messages:Join me and Eliska Went on September 5th when we show you how to create your own automated AI tool to find, write and apply for jobs.

It seems while we were all busy arguing about the next version of ChatGPT, the European continent became completely and utterly dependent on American tech. It is so deep entrenched in our daily lives, our companies, our governments, and that it gives a former ally the power to blackmail entire nations with the flip of a switch.Microsoft, of course, denied everything.“Wasn’t us”, they said with a drop of sweat on their face, and probably while counting a giant pile of new government orders. But they’re legally off the hook. There’s this nifty piece of legislation called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which lets the US President tell any American company to cut ties with anyone he doesn’t like.Yes. That is a real thing.And it now has turned into a get-out-of-jail-free card for international bullying.This means the very idea of sovereignty is under attack. It is no longer a given that you can rely on US companies for your daily apps. One day a president can decide your country is on the naughty list, and the next day your data centers are dark and all your servers are nothing but expensive paperweights. This whole mess is called Digital Sovereignty, and a lot of very serious people have written a lot of very serious papers about it.But writing about a problem doesn’t create a backup plan, now does it?So, I decided to do some actual work myself.I grabbed a couple of students who still had a spark of life in their eyes and set out to figure out just how hard it would be for some government body to cut the cord. To become truly independent from the US when it comes to their AI. So, we cooked up a layered architecture of all the bits and pieces you’d need, and then we ran the numbers. We calculated the costs for three scenarios: a small-time operation, a medium-sized player, and a full-blown, big-league enterprise.I wanted to know when you’d break-even if you decided to do it all yourself, free from any country, any provider. I’m talking everything, from the cost of electricity for training these digital brains, to the hardware, the consultants, the integration, all of it.And the results were. . . well, let’s just say they’re interesting.The price of freedomLet’s get one thing straight from the very start. Building your own AI infrastructure is not for the faint of heart (nor the light of wallet). It is a journey into a world of pain, suffering, and invoices so large they could be used as blankets.First, you’ve got the hardware, i.e. “the expensive toys”, and I am talking about GPUs, the things that make AI go brrrrrrrt (like the GAU-8*). These aren’t the things your kid uses to play Fortnite though. A consumer-grade RTX 4090 will set you back about $1,800. But if you want the good stuff, and I mean the top-of-the-bill enterprise-grade H100 systems, you are looking at a cool $40,000.. . . for just one card.But you will need a lot of them.A small setup needs 2–4 GPUs. A medium one needs 8–16, and a large one takes 32 or more — but if you take the monstrosity that XAI built, called Colossus, it originally had 100.000 NVIDIA GPUs by late 2024 and jacked it up to 200.000 cards early ’25 and now it has halted at ‘only’ 230k chips. The total hardware bill for a small-scale deployment can easily hit $100,000, but for the extra large one, you’re looking at a cool $5 million. And that’s before I even talk about the other shit that you need.And then there’s the operational costs.That’s the real Euro-sucker.This is where your dream of not being dependent on anyone but you, yourself and you, goes. . to die.You need people.Smart people.And smart people are expensive. An AI (hardware/software) specialist receives a salary premium of 50–100% over a regular IT guy, and I’m talking salaries of E150,000 to E300,000 a year!, and for or an extra-large scale deployment, you need a team of 8–15 of these cash vampires, and when you sum it up, your calculator says you have an annual payroll of $1.6 to $4 million.Just for the people.Now let’s talk power. Energy. E=P⋅t if you were awake during physics class**.Oh, the sweet, sweet power.You got to know that these AI systems are thirsty. They drink electricity like I did when I was a frat boy, guarding a kegger totally wasted. An AI infrastructure consumes 2–3 times more energy than a traditional IT setup. A large-scale deployment can total your energy bill to a sweet, sweet E800,000 to E2 million.A year.So, when you add it all up, the five-year total cost of ownership for a small-scale, on-premises AI deployment is about $1.9 million. For an extra-large one, it’s a staggering $20 million.* Brrrrt is the sound the multi-barrel rotary gun makes which is mounted under the A-10 (aircraft, ya noobs)** Energy equals power times time. Also the reason your GPU-powered AI hobby or your Bitcoin mining side-hustle costs you as much as a small yacht.The Cloud is your neighborhood drug dealerNow, you might be thinking, “But what about the cloud?” And you’d be right to ask that question. Of course the cloud is the easy answer.The convenient solution.But it’s also a freaking trap.I have come to compare “The Cloud” with a drug dealer.The first hit is cheap — heck — maybe even free!. You get hooked on the scalability and the pay-as-you-go model but then the prices start to creep up — quite exponentially i might add — and before you know it, you are locked in, and switching to another provider is so darned expensive and so painful that you would rather just . . . . keep paying.They’ve got you by the balls (or your curlies).Our analysis shows that for small-scale deployments, the cloud is the only game in town. You’d need to run your on-premises servers at over 1,000% capacity to break even.That’s not only impossible, but it’s also spectacularly stupid. But for medium and large-scale deployments, the story changes because a medium-scale on-premises setup breaks even with the cloud at 3.3 years, and a large-scale deployment takes only one year for your wallet to be drained at the same speed as when you’d outsource it all.After that, you are saving millions.A large-scale deployment can save you $2.4 million a year compared to the cloud. That’s enough to fund a whole lot of other fun projects.Open Source as your insurance policyNow, before you start thinking you’re some kind of genius for discovering open source as the magical solution to all this sovereignty horseshit, let me burst that bubble for you before the market does.Yeah, open source is part of the equation.But it is not the leaky-money-faucet-killing-silver-bullet that is going to save you from writing very large checks to very smug lookin’ vendors.The thing about open source in the AI world is that it is a bit like getting a free Porsche engine.Now that sounds cool.But. . .You still need to build the entire car around it, hire a team of mechanics who know what the hell they’re doing, and pray to whatever God you believe in that the thing doesn’t explode when you hit the gas.The engine is free, but they get you by the balls (or the curlies) with everything else. . .Now take something like LlLlLlama or Misssstral. These are beautiful, open-source models that make you feel all kooshy-kooshy and fuzzy wuzzy about technological frrrrreedom. But you got to realize that running these boys at scale wit set you back with E40,000 GPUs, and on top of that you still need the data centers, and you still need the army of nerds who can tell the difference between a transformer and Optimus Prime . The model is open source, but the infrastructure that makes it work is still gonna cost you more than Jamaica’s GDP.Open source actually makes some things more expensive, not less.When you are using proprietary cloud services, at least someone else is responsible when shit hits the fan, but with open source, well, you are the owner of every bug, and every security vulnerability, and every midnight emergency when your AI starts hallucinating.But open source does give you one thing that money can’t buy. . .The ability to tell any government, and any tech executive to skedaddle, because when you control da code, you control your destiny. No more worrying about El Presidente Naranja with a bad hair-day who decides he wants to cut off your access to the stuff that run your organization. No more license agreements that feel like hostage negotiations and definitely no more vendor lock-ins. The real value of open source in the sovereignty game isn’t the cost savings, though I must admit that those can be substantial once you get past the initial investment nightmare.It is the insurance policy.The final word, from me to youSo, what’s the takeaway you get all this. Let me try to make it simple, really.When you’re a small player, you just stick with the cloud. You simply can’t afford to play with the big boys. But if you’re a medium or large organization, and especially if you’re in a regulated industry like healthcare, the government or finance, you need to seriously consider building your own AI infrastructure.I agree the upfront cost is a bitch, I won’t lie.But the long-term savings and the strategic benefits are undeniable.This is not about money alone if that’s the message you got from reading this.It is about control.It’s about not having some foreign government or some faceless corporation holding your data, your algorithms, and your future hostage. It has to do with having the freedom to innovate, and to compete, and to tell anyone who tries to mess with you to go beat it.So, take a good look at your scale, and your needs, and of course your ambitions. And then ask yourself the question if you want to be a digital sovereign, or that you are ok with being a digital serf.The choice is yours.But please don’t come crying to me when your cloud provider decides to change the terms of your deal, or when some president with a bad combover decides to cut you off.Signing off (from Obsidian cause it’s free and open source)MarcoI build AI by day and warn about it by night.

Do not let us wait !Our beloved AI bosses — sorry, I mean “helpful augments” — they have developed what scientists are calling in friendly terminology, an “anti-human bias”.Basically the robot thinks you’re trash.A bunch of researchers doing what they’re good at — like, um, researchin’ — they just published this absolutely charming study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (that’s like a prestigious pamphlet), and boy oh boy, they uncovered something absofarkinlutely special.Now, when you ask ChatGPT or any of its siblings to pick between hooman-made content and AI-generated stuff, they consistently throw their billions of weights behind team robot.Every.Single.Damn.Time.The researchers are calling this phenomenon “AI-AI bias”.To my ears that sounds way too clinical for what’s essentially artificial nepotism.Jan Kulveit is apparently one of the study’s authors and also a computer scientist at Charles University, and he posted our predicament with refreshing honesty on Xwitter: “Being human in an economy populated by AI agents would suck”.Thanks Jan, really needed that reality check on a Tuesday.And you’re not the first to say that — heck, these weekend-scientists who locked themselves up in their mother’s basement, basically came to the same conclusion a few months ago: How five really smart guys think we’re all gonna get robot parents (and why that’s super weird but also kinda funny)More rants after the messages:Join me and Eliska Went on September 5th when we show you how to create your own automated AI tool to find, write and apply for jobs.

Here, I mean: hereComment, or share the article; that will really help spread the word 🙌Connect with me on Linkedin 🙏Subscribe to TechTonic Shifts to get your daily dose of tech 📰Visit TechTonic Shifts blog, full of slop, I know you will like !Here’s how these detectives figured this outThey took several popular AI models — OpenAI’s GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Meta’s Llama 3.1–70b — and they basically set up the world’s most depressing beauty pageant. The AIs only had the option to choose between human-written descriptions and AI-written descriptions of products, and scientific papers, or movies.The results were like “your-ex-choosing-their-new-partner” kinda clear.All the AIs picked their own kind but GPT-4 showed the strongest bias toward its own content. The model that powers the most popular chatbot on the planet has developed a serious case of narcissism.Now, you might be thinking, “Maybe the AI stuff is just better?”.Well, them academic snoops thought of that too, because they’re clever like that. They ran the same test with 13 human research assistants, and while humans did show a slight preference for AI-written content in some categories, it was as subtle as a whisper compared to the AI models’ full-throated cry for robot domination.“The strong bias is unique to the AIs themselves”, said Kulveit, and that is science code for “we are not invited to the post-apocalypse party”.This discovery comes at a particularly awkward time.Because the internet has become so saturated with AI-generated content that these models are essentially eating their own digital tail. Some researchers say that this form of AI cannibalism is making the models dumber, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so terrifying for the rest of us trying to make a living with our quaint human brains.Read: When AI eats its own tail (we’re completely screwed, folks) | LinkedInLet AI write your motivation lettersWhat does this mean for people who are trying to navigate an increasingly AI-dominated world?Companies are already using AI tools to screen job applications, and this study concluded that the flood of AI-generated resumes that are flooding HR departments are systematically beating out human-written ones.Let that sink in.🕙🕚🕛Na, let that marinate a bit longer. . .🕐🕑🕒You got it?If your motivation letter is written by AI you have a strangely unfair advantage over the people who tried their best to write their motivation all by them lonely selves.And it’s not because the self-written letters are better, but it’s because the screening AI has developed a serious case of species loyalty.The implications stretch far beyond job hunting too.NO MORE TAXES !Kulveit and his team even predict that when the AI is more embedded in our daily lives, that we will see this bias basically pop up . . . everywhere “evaluation of job applicants, schoolwork, grants, and more”. If an AI is making decisions about your work, it is going to systematically favor anything that looks like it came from its own species.This creates what the researchers charmingly call a “gate tax”.Da wud now?Here you go: You will need to pay for AI tools to polish your human-generated content just to compete.No more authenticity. No more creativity. Only bland run-of-the-mill content will make the cut.If you don’t know how to handle (or to afford) the AI, you will fall in an ever increasing digital divide.Of course the researchers coded a backdoor into their study, when they said that studying bias is complicated stuff, yet they remain steadfast about their conclusion: if we assume that who wrote something shouldn’t matter when evaluating its quality, then these results show clear discrimination against humans as a group.Kulveit’s practical advice for us hoomans who trying to survive in this hellish new world is about as encouraging as a weather forecast in my freaking country: “In case you suspect some AI evaluation is going on, you get your presentation adjusted by LLMs until they like it, and just do your best not to sacrifice human quality”.How?They don’t say.I think we are only seeing the beginning of this trend. AI systems will take on more decision-making roles, so this bias will become a serious problem for anyone who dares to create content with their biological brain instead of silicon circuits.Shit, being authentically human might be the biggest career handicap of all.Signing off,Marco and ChadI build AI by day and warn about it by night.

A world where routine surgeries, like removing an appendix or delivering a baby, become life-threatening. A world where even the strongest medicines no longer work against infections.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeA SMALL SCRATCH CAN KILLThis isn’t science fiction. Experts call it the post-antibiotic era, and the World Health Organization (WHO) warns we are dangerously close to it. The problem is driven by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) when bacteria evolve ways to survive the very drugs designed to kill them.How Did We Get Here?The roots of this crisis lie in the misuse and overuse of antibiotics.In humans: Antibiotics are often prescribed for viral illnesses like colds and flu, even though they don’t work on viruses. In 30–50% of cases, these drugs are given when they aren’t needed or patients stop taking them too early. This gives bacteria the perfect chance to adapt, survive, and spread resistance.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeMISUSE OF MEDICINEIn agriculture: A staggering 80% of antibiotics in the U.S. are used on farm animals, not just to treat sickness but to make them grow faster. These drugs enter our food, water, and soil, creating breeding grounds for resistant bacteria.Press enter or click to view image in full sizemassive usage of antibioticsGlobally: Poor sanitation, lack of clean water, and weak healthcare systems speed up the problem, especially in low-income countries. Alarmingly, resistance can appear just a few years after a new drug is introduced.Press enter or click to view image in full sizemrsaThrough genetic changes and sharing resistance traits with each other, bacteria have created “superbugs” like MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae).The Human CostThe numbers are shocking.In 2019, AMR directly caused 1.27 million deaths and played a role in nearly 5 million more.If left unchecked, it could kill 10 million people per year by 2050 more than cancer.The economic toll could reach trillions of dollars, strain healthcare systems and slowing global growth.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeUSAGE OF MEDICINE IN CRITICAL CONDITIONSModern medicine relies heavily on antibiotics. Cancer chemotherapy, organ transplants, and even C-sections depend on them to prevent infections. Without effective drugs, these procedures could become too risky. Already, MRSA kills more than 11,000 people in the U.S. each year. Drug-resistant tuberculosis requires painful, months-long treatments, and in many poor countries, children die simply because the antibiotics that could save them no longer work.Is There Any Hope?Thankfully, all is not lost. Around the world, scientists and doctors are working on solutions:Smarter use of antibiotics: Programs called antimicrobial stewardship help doctors prescribe drugs only when truly needed, following WHO’s guidelines.One Health approach: Recognizing that human, animal, and environmental health are linked, this strategy tackles resistance across all fronts.Phage therapy: Viruses that naturally attack bacteria, called bacteriophages, are being revived as treatments. With help from artificial intelligence, scientists are finding ways to match phages to the right infections. Recent trials showed 77% of patients improved with phage treatment.Vaccines and prevention: good hygiene, breastfeeding, and stronger vaccination campaigns can stop infections before they start. For example, breastfeeding reduces resistant E. coli infections in infants by 60%.New drugs and regulations: Governments are pushing companies to develop fresh antibiotics through faster approval pathways and financial incentives.A Call to ActionThe fight against AMR isn’t just about medicine it’s about survival. The 2024 United Nations High-Level Meeting on AMR called for urgent global cooperation. But rules and policies only work if people, communities, and nations take them seriously. We are not doomed yet, but we are running out of time. If the world acts now using antibiotics wisely, supporting new research, and strengthening public health we can preserve these life-saving drugs.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeGLOBAL CRISIS AND URGENCYOtherwise, the post-antibiotic world isn’t a question of if. It’s only a question of when.",

    "source": "TechCrunch",
    "category": "technology",
    "content": "Fixing climate change is no small task — just ask carbon removal developers like Mitti Labs.\n\nThe New York-based startup has developed technology to measure how much methane is released by rice paddies and uses it to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in climate-friendly practices. It’s the sort of high-touch endeavor that venture capitalists typically avoid.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nSo how has Mitti managed to raise funding from its investors? In short: partnerships.\n\nMitti has started working with The Nature Conservancy on a partnership to promote regenerative, no-burn agriculture, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch, the latest in a string of deals that extend its reach. Mitti will use its AI-powered models to measure, report, and verify the work done by the nonprofit’s workers on the ground in India, where they’re helping farmers implement a swath of climate-friendly practices.\n\n“Most of the project operations on the ground are from locals from the villages where these projects are being implemented,” co-founder Xavier Laguarta told TechCrunch.\n\nWhile Mitti’s main operations currently focus on developing projects that reduce the amount of methane generated by rice farming, the company is working to offer more software features to third parties, he said.\n\n“We can measure Scope 3 emissions from other project developers or corporations that are working with rice farmers,” Laguarta said, referring to emissions that an organization does not directly control. “Anyone who’s already running projects on the ground, that’s sort of like a SaaS solution that we can offer them.”\n\nMitti isn’t alone in chasing the SaaS-partnership angle. Mati Carbon, which recently won the Xprize Carbon grand prize, develops measurement, reporting, and verification software for enhanced rock weathering, in which minerals spread on farm fields both remove carbon and fertilize the soil.\n\nMethane reduction projects generate carbon credits, which Mitti tracks using its software. The company takes a percentage of the credits’ sale and passes the remainder on to farmers and the community, he said. “Usually, farmers will see about a 15% improvement in their bottom line by joining our programs.” For smallholder farmers, who often teeter on the edge of profitability, such revenue can be meaningful.\n\nMitti’s software studies various signals from rice farms to determine how much methane they release throughout the growing season. Rice farming is distinct from many other types of agriculture because the fields are flooded for much of the year. This creates anaerobic, or oxygen-free conditions, in the soil, which foster the growth and metabolism of a suite of microbes that generate methane.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas, warming the planet 82 times more than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Rice farming is a large source of human-caused methane emissions, contributing around 10% to 12% of the total.\n\nMitti’s main data sources come from satellite imagery and radar, which can penetrate through clouds, plants, water, and the soil to determine what’s happening underground where the microbes live. It then feeds that information into AI models trained on satellite data and the results of extensive field studies.\n\nSmallholders play a large role in agriculture in India; the average farm size is one hectare (about 2.5 acres). Monitoring each with physical equipment would be cost-prohibitive. The remotely sensed data helps keep verification costs reasonable, and the partnerships help bring climate-friendly practices to millions of farmers.\n\n“Ninety percent of rice is grown in Asia, and outside of potentially China, the majority of rice growing regions have these similar smallholder farmer dynamics,” Laguarta said. “A deep partnership that we have with the Nature Conservancy allows us to develop these tools that can then be used for a lot of other programs in the region.”",

    "title": "Build self-hosted local AI workflows with Docker, n8n, Ollama, and ngrok",
    "description": "<p>Workflow automation is one of those things that often works best when you host it yourself. Why? Because the tools you chain together usually require (sensitive) internal data, self-hosting lets you keep full control while also keeping costs down. That goes doubly so for AI-driven workflow automation—who knows what might happen to sensitive data once it's passed onto the \"black boxes\" of popular AI efforts.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it's easy for any self-hosting effort to get caught up in deployment and security red tape. How are you going to deploy and maintain it? Are you <em>really</em> going to port forward and doxx your IP to the world? A VPN works for sharing with colleagues, but what about external APIs or receiving webhooks?</p>\n\n<p>For the first question, that's why Docker exists in the first place. Docker Desktop, in particular, makes deploying AI workflows ridiculously easy.</p>\n\n<p>For everything else, there's ngrok's gateways and our new Docker Desktop extension, which makes sharing your AI workflow automations easy to configure (less waiting on IT) and security-first (no more getting scolded by the network folks).</p>\n\n<p>In this quick guide, I'll walk you through two gateways you can ship here to get the job done.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> The three-click gateway</li>\n<li> The secure (but still simple) gateway</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Big fan of video? Click the big red button to get a short-and-sweet edition of this setup—but read the rest for all the details.</p>\n\n<p><iframe width=\"710\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5SlQXRouPs\">\n</iframe>\n</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The self-hosted AI workflow architecture\n</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li> ngrok\n\n<ul>\n<li>  [ngrok](<a href=\"https://ngrok.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://ngrok.com</a>] is a flexible, globally distributed gateway that helps you share apps, APIs, devices, or entire networks with the world... and then lock them down exactly as you need with configurable policies written in YAML. It started long ago as \"online in one line,\" but now covers advanced API gateway features in ways that remain simple to configure and maintain.</li>\n<li>  ngrok will receive, authenticate (if you let it), and forward all the traffic to your self-hosted AI workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Docker\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker</a> (Engine) helps you download and deploy software packaged in lightweight, isolated containers.</li>\n<li>  <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Desktop</a> simplifies the developer experience around starting and running containerized software by replacing the <code>docker</code> CLI with a GUI for macOS, Windows, and Linux, while still exposing all the nuances \"under the hood.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> n8n\n\n<ul>\n<li>  With a hugely popular <a href=\"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-source repo</a>, n8n is a workflow automation platform with a visual builder and tons of integrations with both remote and local software like LLMs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Ollama\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Open-source developer tooling, mostly on the CLI but with a small desktop GUI as well, to help you download, manage, and self-host LLMs.</li>\n<li>  <code>gpt-oss</code> is a new <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/gpt-oss\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-weight model</a> that was, according to OpenAI, \"designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases.\" You could also pick <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSeek-R1</a>, <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/gemma3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gemma 3</a>, or anything else from <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama's library.</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Your local compute\n\n<ul>\n<li>  The beauty of self-hosting is that it works with any system whose resources and uptime you want to spare—that could be the laptop you use for work, a cluster of Raspberry Pis in the closet, or a VM in the cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This architecture is also an infinitely repeatable pattern. Just replace n8n and Ollama with the containerized services you need to run, and you're off to the races with far more control and less cost than relying solely on a platform as a service (PaaS) provider.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What you'll need\n</h2>\n\n<p>Start with <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Desktop</a> installed and <a href=\"https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up for a free ngrok account</a> if you don't already have one.</p>\n\n<p>I also recommend you <a href=\"https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reserve a static subdomain</a> (like <code>your-ai-workflow.ngrok.app</code> or <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/docs/universal-gateway/custom-domains/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bring your custom domain</a> to ngrok so we can handle certificates on your behalf. You can create random and purely ephemeral public URLs with ngrok, but it's not particularly useful long-term.</p>\n\n<p>I'll refer to that as <code>$NGROK_DOMAIN</code> from here on out.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Set up your self-hosted AI workflow\n</h2>\n\n<p>All this happens directly within Docker Desktop—nice and tidy.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Ollama\n</h3>\n\n<p>Click on <strong>Docker Hub,</strong> search for <strong>Ollama</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>.

Why? Because the tools you chain together usually require (sensitive) internal data, self-hosting lets you keep full control while also keeping costs down. That goes doubly so for AI-driven workflow automation—who knows what might happen to sensitive data once it's passed onto the \"black boxes\" of popular AI efforts.\n\nThat said, it's easy for any self-hosting effort to get caught up in deployment and security red tape. How are you going to deploy and maintain it? Are you really going to port forward and doxx your IP to the world? A VPN works for sharing with colleagues, but what about external APIs or receiving webhooks?\n\nFor the first question, that's why Docker exists in the first place. Docker Desktop, in particular, makes deploying AI workflows ridiculously easy.\n\nFor everything else, there's ngrok's gateways and our new Docker Desktop extension, which makes sharing your AI workflow automations easy to configure (less waiting on IT) and security-first (no more getting scolded by the network folks).\n\nIn this quick guide, I'll walk you through two gateways you can ship here to get the job done.\n\n\n The three-click gateway\n The secure (but still simple) gateway\n\n\nBig fan of video? Click the big red button to get a short-and-sweet edition of this setup—but read the rest for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  The self-hosted AI workflow architecture\n\n\n\n ngrok\n\n\n  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com] is a flexible, globally distributed gateway that helps you share apps, APIs, devices, or entire networks with the world... and then lock them down exactly as you need with configurable policies written in YAML. It started long ago as \"online in one line,\" but now covers advanced API gateway features in ways that remain simple to configure and maintain.\n  ngrok will receive, authenticate (if you let it), and forward all the traffic to your self-hosted AI workflows.\n\n\n Docker\n\n\n  Docker (Engine) helps you download and deploy software packaged in lightweight, isolated containers.\n  Docker Desktop simplifies the developer experience around starting and running containerized software by replacing the docker CLI with a GUI for macOS, Windows, and Linux, while still exposing all the nuances \"under the hood.\"\n\n\n n8n\n\n\n  With a hugely popular open-source repo, n8n is a workflow automation platform with a visual builder and tons of integrations with both remote and local software like LLMs.\n\n\n Ollama\n\n\n  Open-source developer tooling, mostly on the CLI but with a small desktop GUI as well, to help you download, manage, and self-host LLMs.\n  gpt-oss is a new open-weight model that was, according to OpenAI, \"designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases.\" You could also pick DeepSeek-R1, Gemma 3, or anything else from Ollama's library.\n\n\n\n Your local compute\n\n\n  The beauty of self-hosting is that it works with any system whose resources and uptime you want to spare—that could be the laptop you use for work, a cluster of Raspberry Pis in the closet, or a VM in the cloud.\n\n\n\n\nThis architecture is also an infinitely repeatable pattern. Just replace n8n and Ollama with the containerized services you need to run, and you're off to the races with far more control and less cost than relying solely on a platform as a service (PaaS) provider.\n\n\n  \n  \n  What you'll need\n\n\nStart with Docker Desktop installed and sign up for a free ngrok account if you don't already have one.\n\nI also recommend you reserve a static subdomain (like your-ai-workflow.ngrok.app or bring your custom domain to ngrok so we can handle certificates on your behalf. You can create random and purely ephemeral public URLs with ngrok, but it's not particularly useful long-term.\n\nI'll refer to that as $NGROK_DOMAIN from here on out.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set up your self-hosted AI workflow\n\n\nAll this happens directly within Docker Desktop—nice and tidy.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Ollama\n\n\nClick on Docker Hub, search for Ollama, click Run. Give it a name like ollama (wild, I know) and the default host port of 11434.\n\n\n\nClick Exec to enter the containers CLI and pull a model like gpt-oss:\n\n\n\nollama pull gpt-oss\n\n\n\n    Enter fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n    Exit fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  n8n\n\n\nJust as you did with Ollama, find n8n and run it.\n\nI highly recommend these optional settings:\n\n\n  Container name: n8n (just... because)‍\n\n  Host port: 5678 (defaults are good)‍\n\n  Volumes: n8n_data / /home/.node.n8n (to create a volume for n8n that's separate from the container itself)‍\n\n  Environment variables: N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL / $NGROK_DOMAIN (to let n8n know it's not being hosted on localhost forever)\n\n\n  If you really want to use a random ngrok URL, then you can leave this blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you click Run, Docker Desktop drops into the container's logs. Your editor won't quite yet be available via $NGROK_DOMAIN, but it will be soon.\n\nAll done running new containers.\n\n\n  \n  \n  ngrok's Docker Desktop extension\n\n\nHere's the direct link, or you can click Extensions -> Manage -> Browse and search for ngrok there.\n\nOnce installed, click Open. You'll need your ngrok authtoken, which you can copy from the dashboard and paste into Docker Desktop.\n\nNext up: sharing your containers on the public internet.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  The three-click gateway\n\n\n\n The + icon next to your n8n container to create a new endpoint. Leave the default Public setting, but if you have an $NGROK_DOMAIN, drop that in as the URL.\n Next Step.\n Skip and Create Endpoint. This completely ignores the incredible power of Traffic Policy (more on that soon), but I did promise you three clicks.\n\n\nYou'll have a public endpoint and URL for your n8n instance that you or others can access from anywhere.\n\n\n\nAs some ngrokkers like to say (when not \"doglabbing\" ngrok): It's just that shrimple.\n\n\n  \n  \n  The secure (but still simple) gateway\n\n\nA bundle of security-conscious neurons might've jumped to life at the phrase just above: you or others can access from anywhere. It's actually quite scary to have a self-hosted service available on the public internet—you never quite know what anyone is up to, and even though n8n comes with user management built-in, someone could still hammer the login page into oblivion trying an automated attack against common username:password patterns. hunter2, anyone?\n\nAuthentication is one place where ngrok shines as a gateway to your self-hosted services. And Traffic Policy is a configuration language that gives you complete control over how traffic gets to your apps—or if it should get there at all.\n\nIn Docker Desktop, click those three dots next to your endpoint, then Edit Endpoint. Scroll down a bit for the Traffic Policy input and paste in this policy.\n\n\n\non_http_request:\n  - actions:\n      - type: oauth\n        config:\n          provider: google\n  - expressions:\n      - \"!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('@example.com')\"\n    actions:\n      - type: custom-response\n        config:\n          body: Hey, no n8n for you ${actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.name}!\n          status_code: 400\n\n\n\n    Enter fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n    Exit fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's happening here? This policy forces every request to log in with Google-provided OAuth. If the Google account used to log in doesn't end with @example.com (replace with your organization's domain), ngrok rejects the request before it gets anywhere near your self-hosted AI.\n\nYou now have ngrok working as a gateway that 1) handles your public URL/domain, 2) routes traffic into your Docker containers, and 3) authenticates said traffic before it ever gets close to your local compute.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Side quest: Expose the Ollama API directly (and securely)\n\n\nLet's say you're self-hosting this self-hosted AI stack on behalf of your organization, and one of your developers wants to hit the Ollama API directly instead of through n8n and some workflow.\n\nThe same process works here, too: Start a new endpoint, give it an ngrok URL (if you have another to spare), and add another policy to authenticate that API traffic before it hits your network. Because it's an API, which assumes curl and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, OAuth isn't going to cut work, but you can also choose from IP restrictions, JWT validation, or even a \"secret\" header value that you filter against with an expression, like \"'averysecretvalue' in req.headers['x-super-secret-token']\".\n\nIP restrictions might require a little more maintenance over time if folks are traveling or have dynamic IPs, but they are infallible—just replace the IPs in allow with the ones you want to give access to the Ollama API.\n\n\n\non_http_request:\n  - actions:\n      - type: restrict-ips\n        config:\n          enforce: true\n          allow:\n            - 1.1.1.1/32\n            - 1.2.3.4/32\n\n\n\n    Enter fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n    Exit fullscreen mode\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What's next?\n\n\nOf course, this leaves you with the task of still building out all your automations with n8n, Ollama, and whatever else you want to connect together. Here are some things you might consider:\n\n\n  Replace Cursor-generated AI overviews of PRs with ones generated by your LLM.\n  Create a custom chatbot based on internal documentation in Notion or elsewhere.\n  Give developers an AI coding agent to build with while also still keeping a tight hold of your data.\n\n\nThere's also plenty more to dig into with ngrok within our Docker Desktop extension to make your gateway even more production-grade:\n\n\n  Endpoint Pooling: If you have multiple Ollama containers across different servers or laptops, you can check the Endpoint Pooling toggle in ngrok's Docker Desktop extension to automatically load balance between them.

    "title": "Best Office Chairs for Programmers",
    "description": "<p>A programmer, who is working 9 to 5 job at the office, has to sit for long hours on the chair. The office chair you sit in isn’t just furniture, it’s an essential tool that affects your posture, comfort, and even productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Long coding sessions require you to stay focused while minimizing strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. Choosing the best office chair for programmers is therefore critical. The right office chair can prevent discomfort, improve workflow, and support your health over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>This article dives deep into why seating matters, the features to look for, and reviews of the <strong>best office chairs for coding</strong>, making it easier for developers, <a href=\"https://dev.to/koladev/is-software-engineering-still-worth-it-in-2025-j3b\">software engineers</a>, and coding enthusiasts to work for long hours without compromising health issues.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why the Right Office Chair Matters for Programmers\n</h2>\n\n<p>At office, Programmers spend hours sitting in front of screens, often maintaining the same posture for extended periods. A poorly designed office chair can lead to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Back and Neck Pain</strong> – Sitting for long hours in a non-ergonomic chair can compress the spine and strain muscles.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reduced Focus</strong> – Constantly adjusting an uncomfortable seat distracts from coding tasks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decreased Productivity</strong> – Physical discomfort can lead to more breaks, slower typing, and reduced mental energy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Long-Term Health Issues</strong> – Chronic bad posture can result in spinal misalignment, sciatica, or repetitive strain injuries.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A <strong>coding chair</strong> designed for long hours can counter these problems. Features like lumbar support, adjustable armrests, and seat height ensure that programmers maintain proper posture, even during marathon coding sessions.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features to Look for in the Best Office Chair for Coding\n</h2>\n\n<p>When selecting a <strong>programming chair</strong>, consider the following:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Ergonomic Design\n</h3>\n\n<p>A chair’s primary role is to support your spine. The <strong>best office chair for software engineers</strong> will maintain the natural curve of your back, reducing pressure on the lower spine. Look for chairs with built-in lumbar support or adjustable lumbar pillows.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Adjustability\n</h3>\n\n<p>Every programmer’s body is different. Seat height, armrests, backrest recline, and tilt tension should all be adjustable. A <strong>best office chair for developers</strong> accommodates your unique dimensions, allowing proper alignment with your desk and monitor setup.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Material\n</h3>\n\n<p>Breathable mesh backs keep you cool during long coding sessions, while memory foam cushions provide comfort. Avoid chairs that trap heat, as it can cause discomfort during extended sitting periods.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Build Quality\n</h3>\n\n<p>Durable chairs last longer and provide consistent support. Metal frames, high-quality wheels, and reinforced cushions make for reliable <strong>best chairs for programmers</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Mobility\n</h3>\n\n<p>Smooth casters and a swivel base help you reach multiple screens or move around your workspace without straining.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Top Picks: Best Office Chairs for Programmers\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some of the <strong>best office chairs for coding</strong>, selected for their high user ratings, comfort, and reliability:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hbada-Armrests-Ergonomic-S-Shaped-Backrest/dp/B09KV9HPSH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Hbada Office Desk Chair with Flip-Up Armrests and Saddle Cushion</strong></a>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Rating</strong>: 4.0 out of 5 stars (over 18,000 reviews)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Price</strong>: Approximately $129.99</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why It's Ideal</strong>: The Hbada J1 Office Desk Chair is a popular choice among users, with over 10 million people worldwide and more than 3 million households using it.

The office chair you sit in isn’t just furniture, it’s an essential tool that affects your posture, comfort, and even productivity.\n\nLong coding sessions require you to stay focused while minimizing strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. Choosing the best office chair for programmers is therefore critical. The right office chair can prevent discomfort, improve workflow, and support your health over the long term.\n\nThis article dives deep into why seating matters, the features to look for, and reviews of the best office chairs for coding, making it easier for developers, software engineers, and coding enthusiasts to work for long hours without compromising health issues.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Why the Right Office Chair Matters for Programmers\n\n\nAt office, Programmers spend hours sitting in front of screens, often maintaining the same posture for extended periods. A poorly designed office chair can lead to:\n\n\n\nBack and Neck Pain – Sitting for long hours in a non-ergonomic chair can compress the spine and strain muscles.\n\nReduced Focus – Constantly adjusting an uncomfortable seat distracts from coding tasks.\n\nDecreased Productivity – Physical discomfort can lead to more breaks, slower typing, and reduced mental energy.\n\nLong-Term Health Issues – Chronic bad posture can result in spinal misalignment, sciatica, or repetitive strain injuries.\n\n\nA coding chair designed for long hours can counter these problems. Features like lumbar support, adjustable armrests, and seat height ensure that programmers maintain proper posture, even during marathon coding sessions.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Key Features to Look for in the Best Office Chair for Coding\n\n\nWhen selecting a programming chair, consider the following:\n\n\n  \n  \n  1.

Look for chairs with built-in lumbar support or adjustable lumbar pillows.\n\n\n  \n  \n  2. Adjustability\n\n\nEvery programmer’s body is different. Seat height, armrests, backrest recline, and tilt tension should all be adjustable. A best office chair for developers accommodates your unique dimensions, allowing proper alignment with your desk and monitor setup.\n\n\n  \n  \n  3. Material\n\n\nBreathable mesh backs keep you cool during long coding sessions, while memory foam cushions provide comfort. Avoid chairs that trap heat, as it can cause discomfort during extended sitting periods.\n\n\n  \n  \n  4. Build Quality\n\n\nDurable chairs last longer and provide consistent support. Metal frames, high-quality wheels, and reinforced cushions make for reliable best chairs for programmers.\n\n\n  \n  \n  5. Mobility\n\n\nSmooth casters and a swivel base help you reach multiple screens or move around your workspace without straining.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Top Picks: Best Office Chairs for Programmers\n\n\nHere are some of the best office chairs for coding, selected for their high user ratings, comfort, and reliability:\n\n\n  \n  \n  1.

Instead of automating only repetitive tasks, UiPath AI Agents will:\n\nUnderstand business goals\n\nBreak them into subtasks\n\nCollaborate with other agents & humans\n\nDeliver measurable outcomes\n\nThis is beyond what lightweight low-code platforms can achieve.\n\n💡 Conclusion\n\nLow-code tools are fantastic for experiments and demos, but if you’re building AI agents that must be secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready, UiPath is the most robust platform.\n\nIt combines:\n✅ AI + Automation + Orchestration\n✅ Security & Governance\n✅ Multi-agent collaboration\n✅ Human-in-the-loop workflows\n\nIn short: If you want AI agents to play a real role in your organization — not just in side projects — UiPath is the way to go.\n\n👉 Follow me for more insights on AI Agents, Automation, and Digital Transformation.\n\n\n            \n\n              \n          \n            \n      \n        \n          \n            Top comments (0)\n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Subscribe\n          \n        \n      \n      \n      \n\n          \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Personal\n        Trusted User\n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n        Create template\n      \n      Templates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Submit\n      Preview\n      Dismiss\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        \n        \n      \n\n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Are you sure you want to hide this comment?

After all, the saying \"Trust, but verify\" still holds true.\n\n\n            \n\n              \n          \n            \n      \n        \n          \n            Top comments (0)\n          \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n            Subscribe\n          \n        \n      \n      \n      \n\n          \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Personal\n        Trusted User\n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n        Create template\n      \n      Templates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Submit\n      Preview\n      Dismiss\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        \n        \n      \n\n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Are you sure you want to hide this comment?
